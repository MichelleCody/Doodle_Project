### Running the Program

The program was developed on Android Studio and used Android Studio's build-in design toolkit via the WYSIWYG editor.  
A custom view was also created for the touch functionality. The API I used was API 21: Android 5.0 Lollipop.  
To run the program, open the project in Android Studio and just run the application.
